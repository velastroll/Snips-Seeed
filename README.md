# ðŸ§  ASSISTANT BRAIN

This repository contians the logic of the assistant.
When snips is working, it sends by a MQTT server specific data which is the *intent* and *slots* programmed at [snips-console](https://console.snips.ai).

`./setup.py`: execute specific scheduled task.

`./action/`: contains the triggered actions by the MQTT server.

`./task/`: contains the scheduled task as **ALIVE** to send scheduled request to the server.

## Requirements

If you want to deploy this on your assistant, it's very important change some things:

- At `#23 /setup.py` you should put the name of your repository.
